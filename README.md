# TORCS-AI Neural Network Racing System

This project implements a multi-model neural network approach for a TORCS AI racing system. The system uses multiple specialized neural networks to handle different aspects of racing.

## Architecture

The system consists of multiple specialized neural networks:

1. **High-Level Planning Model**: Strategic decisions about racing line and overall strategy
2. **Tactical Model**: Medium-term decisions for speed control and overtaking
3. **Low-Level Control Model**: Immediate control outputs for steering, acceleration, and braking
4. **Gear Selection Model**: Specialized model for optimal gear selection
5. **Corner Handling Model**: Specialized model for handling corners effectively

## Key Components

- **data_processor.py** - Preprocesses telemetry data for training
- **models.py** - Defines neural network architectures
- **train_models.py** - Trains all five models
- **model_coordinator.py** - Coordinates predictions from all models
- **driver.py** - Interfaces with TORCS and applies the model outputs
- **pyclient.py** - Main client for connecting to TORCS server

## How to Use

### Training the Models

1. Collect telemetry data by driving manually with data logging enabled
2. Train all models with:
```
python train_models.py
```

### Running the System

1. Start the TORCS server with the SCR server enabled
2. Connect the AI client:
```
python pyclient.py --host localhost --port 3001 --models_dir models
```

### Debugging

If you encounter issues with model compatibility, you can check model details with:
```
python check_models.py
```

## Implementation Details

The system uses LSTM networks for each model to handle sequential data. Each model is trained on a specific subset of the available sensor data, with features specifically selected for its task.

The `ModelCoordinator` class handles sequence history for each model type and maintains separate preprocessed inputs for each model.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see feature count mismatch errors, check that the feature processing in `model_coordinator.py` matches what was used during training.
- The model coordinator maintains a history buffer (sequence) for each model to feed into the LSTM networks.
- If you change model architectures, you'll need to retrain all models to ensure compatibility.

## Introduction

This project is about building a Machine Learning-based car racing controller using **TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator)**. The objective is to design a controller that can race and win against other cars on different tracks. The controller uses telemetry data collected from the simulator to learn driving actions through a Neural Network.

## TORCS Architecture

- **Client-Server Model:** Bots run as external processes and connect to the TORCS race server via UDP.
- **Real-time Processing:**
  - Every 20ms simulated time (a game tick), the server sends sensor data.
  - Bots have 10ms real time to respond with actions.
- **Abstraction Layer:** Separates driver code and server.
  - Programming language freedom (Python, Java, C++, C# clients available).
  - Controlled access to game information.

---

## Objective

Design and implement an ML-based controller that:

- Wins races by completing tracks fastest.
- Balances speed, obstacle avoidance, and track following.
- Uses telemetry sensors data.
- Rule-based controllers are **not** acceptable.

**Simplifications:**

- No noisy sensors.
- No car damage.
- Unlimited fuel.

  - **Inputs:** Sensors (speed, track position, angle, etc.)
  - **Outputs:** Actions (steering, throttle, brake)

### 2. ML & Neural Network

- Teach the car to map sensors ‚û°Ô∏è actions.
- Uses collected data to learn how to drive.
- Use Neural Network model

### Tools & Libraries

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib
```

or better

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# SCRC Python Client

## Usage

To run the client in manual mode, use the following command:

`python pyclient.py --manual`

When running in manual mode, you'll be prompted whether to log telemetry data:
```
Do you want to log telemetry data? (y/n):
```
- Type `y` to enable telemetry logging (saved to a timestamped file in telemetry_logs/)
- Type `n` to disable telemetry logging

### Training with Manual Mode Data

To train a model using only data collected in manual mode:

```bash
python controller/main.py --train --data telemetry_logs/manual_telemetry_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv --save_scaler --manual_mode_only
```

The `--manual_mode_only` flag ensures only data points marked as collected in manual mode are used for training.

## Important Notes

Close the telemetry CSV file before running TORCS again!

If the CSV file remains open, it may cause issues with logging new data.

Requirements

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. If necessary, install them using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
